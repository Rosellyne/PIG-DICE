+ If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.

+ If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.

+ If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.

+ The first player to score 100 or more points wins.
